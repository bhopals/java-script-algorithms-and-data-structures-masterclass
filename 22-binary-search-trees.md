### Binary Search

- OBJECTIVES

  - Define what a tree is?
  - Compare and contrast trees and lists
  - Explain the differences between Trees, Binary Trees, and binary search trees (BST)
  - Implement operations on Binary Search Trees (BST)

#### Introduction

- WHAT IS A TREE?

  - A data structure that consists of NODES in a PARENT/CHILD relationship

- LINKED LISTS / DOUBLY LINKED LISTS are `LINEAR`
- TREES are `NONLINEAR`

- TREE RULES

  - A NODE in a tree CAN ONLY reference nodes that are below them
  - A NODE CAN ONLY point to a CHILD,
  - We CANNOT have a CHILD Pointing to a Parents
  - We CANNOT have a NODE Pointing to a Sibling
  - A ROOT Cannot have two beginning points - Every Root must have one Parent
  - In TREE, Every NODE is moving away from the ROOT NODE
  - ALL the Arrows have to point downwards from the ROOR (PARENT ==> CHILD)

- TERMINOLOGY

  - ROOT - The Top Node is a TREE
  - CHILD - A Node directly connected to another node when moving away from the ROOT
  - PARENT - The converse notion of a CHILD
  - SIBLINGS - A Group of nodes with the same PARENT
  - LEAF - A Node with no CHILDREN on the Tree (The last element - bottom most)
  - EDGE - The connection between one node and another (`ARROW` ===>)

#### Uses For Trees

- TREES Real World Use Cases
  - HTML DOM
  - JSON Object Parsing
  - Network Routing
  - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
  - Artificial Intelligence (To predict Possible moves in a GAME) - Example: Tic Tac Toe Game
  - Folders in Operation Systems
  - Computer Files System

- TOPICS WE FOCUS ON

  - TREES
    - In a Tree, EACH NODE can have 0...N Children
  - BINARY TREES
    - In Binary Tree, EACH NODE can have 0..2 Children (MAX 2)
  - BINARY SEARCH TREES
    - In Binary SEARCH Tree, EACH NODE can have 0..2 Children (MAX 2)
    - Binary Search Trees are used to store data that can be COMPARED and that is SORTABLE
    - It is SORTED in a Particular Way
      - Left Side of the NODE will have the Number/Value that is LESS than PARENT NODE
      - Right Side of the NODE will have the Number/Value that is GREATER than PARENT NODE

- HOW BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST) WORKS
  - Every parent node has at most TWO children (0...2)
  - Every node to the LEFT of a Parent Node is always LESS than the Parent
  - Every node to the RIGHT of a Parent Node is always GREATER than the Parent

#### Searching A Binary Search Trees

- RECAP RULES

  - Two Children at MOST
  - LEFT - Always LESS than Parent Node
  - RIGHT - Always GREATER than Parent Node

- Example:

```
      10
  5       13
2  7   11   16
```

#### Binary Search Tree (BST) Classes

- BinarySearchTree

```
class BinarySearchTree {
    constructor(){
        this.root = null;
    }
}
```

- Node

```
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}
```

#### Binary Search Tree (BST): Insert

- Inserting a Node in a Binary Tree

- INSERT Pseudocode (Steps - ITERATIVELY or RECURSIVELY)

  - Create a new Node
  - Strating at the ROOT
    - Check if there is a ROOT, IF NOT - The Root noew becomes the new node!
    - If there is a ROOT, check if the value of the new node is GREATER than or LESS than the value of the ROOT
    - If it is GREATER
      - Check to see if there is a node to the RIGHT
        - If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps
        - If there is not, add that node as the RIGHT property
  - If it is LESS
    - Check to see if there is a node to the LEFT
      - If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps
      - If there is not, add that node as the LEFT property

- INSERT Code

```
insert(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.root) {
      this.root = newNode;
      return this;
    }

    // ELSE Case
    let current = this.root;
    while (true) {
      if (value === current.value) return undefined; // Handle Duplicates
      if (value < current.value) {
        if (current.left === null) {
          current.left = newNode;
          return this;
        }
        current = current.left;
      } else if (value > current.value) {
        if (current.right === null) {
          current.right = newNode;
          return this;
        }
        current = current.right;
      }
    }
  }
```

#### Binary Search Tree (BST): Search/Find/Contains

- Finding a Node in a Binary Search Tree

- SEARCH/FIND/CONTAINS Pseudocode - (Steps - Iteratively or Recursively)

  - Starting at the ROOT
    - Check if there is a ROOT, if not - We are DONE Searching! - return null/undefined
    - If there is a ROOT, check if the value of the new NODE is the value we are looking for.
      - If we FOUND! it, we are done!
    - If NOT, check to see if the value is GREATER than or less than the value of the root
    - If it is GREATER
      - Check to see if there is a node to the RIGHT
        - If there is, move to that node and REPEAT the steps
        - If there is NOT, we are DONE searching!
    - If it is LESS
      - Check to see if there is a node to the LEFT
        - If there is, move to that node and REPEAT the steps
        - If there is NOT, we are DONE searching!

- FIND Code
- If found return the node

```
  /*** Find to Return the NODE once Matched */
find(value) {
  if (this.root === null) return false;

  let current = this.root;
  let found = false;
  while (current && !found) {
    if (value < current) {
      current = current.left;
    } else if (value > current.value) {
      current = current.right;
    } else {
      found = true;
    }
  }
  //NOT Found
  if (!found) return false;

  return current;
}

```

- If found return TRUE, else FALSE

```
/*** Find to Return the TRUE once Matched */
contains(value) {
  if (this.root === null) return false;
  let current = this.root;
  let found = false;
  while (current && !found) {
    if (value < current) {
      current = current.left;
    } else if (value > current.value) {
      current = current.right;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
}

```

#### Big O of Binary Search Tree (BST)

- TIME COMPLEXITY

  - BEST CASE SCENARIOS
    - INSERTION - `O(log n)`
    - SEARCHING - `O(log n)`

- Best Case, not always guaranteed :(
