### Singly Linked List

- OBJECTIVES

  - Define what a Singly Linked List is
  - Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays
  - Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on Singly Linked List

- WHAT IS A LINKED LIST??

  - Ordered list of elements
  - A data structure that contains a HEAD, TAIL, and LENGTH property
  - Linked Lists consist of NODES, and each NODE has a VALUE and a POINTER to another node or NULL
  - The each element in the Linked List is called a NODE, that has VALUE and REFEReNCE of
    the next node (NULL if its last NODE)
  - In other words, A Linked List is a bunch of NODES pointing to other nodes.
  - It does not have any indexes like ARRAYs

- COMPARISONS WITH ARRAYS

  - LINKED LISTS

    - Do not have INDEXES!
    - Connected via NODES with a NEXT Pointer
    - Randow Acess is not allowed

  - ARRAYS
    - Indexed in order!
    - Insertion and Deletion can be expensive (As everything needs to be reindexed)
    - Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
