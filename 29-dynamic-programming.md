### Dynamic Programming

- OBJECTIVES

  - Define what Dynamic Programming is
  - Explain what OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS are
  - Understand what OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE is
  - Solve more challanging problems using Dynamic Programming

- OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS and OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE are two conditions/indicators to use
  Dynamic Programming on a given problem.

#### Intro to Dynamic Programming

- DEFINITION

  - A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems,
    solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

- WHERE DOES THE NAME "DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING" COME FROM?
  - It is not any other programming language, but just a process of solving a problem where one needs
    to find the best decisions one after another.
  - It refers to find an optimal program to solve a problem
