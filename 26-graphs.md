  - Explain what a GRAPH is
  - Compare and Contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
  - Implement a GRAPH using an Adjacency list
  - Traverse through a GRAPH using BFS and DFS
  - Compare and Contrast Graph Traversal algorithms

- WHAT ARE GRAPHS

  - A GRAPH data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of VERTICES or NODES or POINTS,
    together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an UNIDIRECTED GRAPH or a set of Ordered
    pairs for a DIRECTED GRAPH.

  - In other words, A GRAPH is a collection of Nodes and Connection between those Nodes.
  - A Graph is consists of NODES + CONNECTIONS
