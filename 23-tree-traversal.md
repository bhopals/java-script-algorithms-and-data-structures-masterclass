### Tree Traversal

- OBJECTIVES

#### Intro To Tree Traversal

- Given any tree, this Traversal Algo will be used

- For Example

  - Traverse the tree to VISIT EVERY NODE ONCE

- TRAVERSING A TREE (Two Ways)
  - Breadth-first SEARCH (BFS)
    - Going across the tree - Right to Left starting from the top
  - Depth-first SEARCH (DFS)
    - Vertical Traversing - Top to Bottom till the end of the Node recursively all the way to the RIGHT
