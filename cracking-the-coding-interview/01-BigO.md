#### Big O

- TIme Complexity

  - O (Big O) - It describes an upper bound on the time (Worst Case Performance)

    - Big O Notation is used to describe `asymptotic upper bound`.

  - Ω (Big Omega) - It describes a lower bound on the time (Best Case Performance)

  - Θ (Big Theta) - It gives tight bound on runtime

- DIFFERENCE

Big Oh (O) Big Omega (Ω) Big Theta (Θ)

1. Rate of Growth

   - It is like (<=) rate of growth of an algorithm is less than or equal to a specific value.
   - It is like (>=) rate of growth is greater than or equal to a specified value.
   - It is like (==) meaning the rate of growth is equal to a specified value.

2. Bound

- The upper bound of algorithm is represented by Big O notation.
  Only the above function is bounded by Big O. asymptotic upper bond is it given by Big O notation.

- The algorithm’s lower bound is represented by Omega notation.
  The asymptotic lower bond is given by Omega notation.

- The bounding of function from above and below is represented by theta notation.
  The exact asymptotic behavior is done by this theta notation.

3. Bound

   - Big oh (O) – Upper Bound
   - Big Omega (Ω) – Lower Bound
   - Big Theta (Θ) – Tight Bound

4. Bound

   - It is define as upper bound and upper bound on an algorithm is
     the most amount of time required ( the worst case performance).
   - It is define as lower bound and lower bound on an algorithm is the least amount of
     time required ( the most efficient way possible, in other words best case).
   - It is define as tightest bound and tightest bound is the best of all the worst case times
     that the algorithm can take.

5. Mathematical Equation
   - Mathematically: Big Oh is 0 <= f(n) <= Cg(n) for all n >= n0
   - Mathematically: Big Omega is 0 <= Cg(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0
   - Mathematically – Big Theta is 0 <= C2g(n) <= f(n) <= C1g(n) for n >= n0

- Best Case, Worst Case, and Expected Case

  - We can atcually describe our Runtime in these three ways

- Relationship between Best/Worst/Expected case AND Big O/Theta/Omega

  - Best/Worst/Expected case describes the BIG O (or Big Theta) time for particular inputs or scenarios
  - Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta describes the UPPER, LOWER, and TIGHT bounds for the Runtime.

- Space Complexity

- KEYWORDS
  - Asympotic upper bound / lower bound
  - Three ways to describe RUNTIME (Best, Worst, Expected Case)
  - Best/Worst/Expected case describes the BIG O (or Big Theta) time for particular inputs or scenarios
  - Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta describes the UPPER, LOWER, and TIGHT bounds for the Runtime.
