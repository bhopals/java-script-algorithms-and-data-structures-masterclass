### Stacks

- OBJECTIVES

  - Define what a stack is
  - Understand use cases for a stack
  - Implement operations on a stack data structure

#### Intro to Stacks

- WHAT IS A STACK?

  - It is an abstract data collection.
  - A LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure
  - The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.Ã¥

- HOW IS IT USED?

  - Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or a stack of ... anything.
  - AS you pile it up, the last thing (or the topmost thing) is what gets removed first.
  - You could use LinkedList to implement it (But there are other ways as well)

  - Javascript Call Stack (when we run recursion code), we have seen how stacks are added in callstack (LIFO)

- WHERE STACKS ARE USED

  - Managing function invocations
  - Undo / Redo Commands (CTRL + Z / CTRL + Y)
  - Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!

- There is more than one way of implmentating a stack

#### Creating a Stack with an Array

- There is more than one way of implmentating a stack
