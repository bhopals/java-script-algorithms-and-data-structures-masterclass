### Data Structures

- WHAT DO THEY DO??

  - Data structures are collections of values, they contain relationships among these values, and
    the functions or operatios that can be applied to the data.
  - For example, ARRAY - it holds many values, it contains relationships between those values,
    it does have some in-build methods and functionality ways of interating with them, adding to them,
    removing, push, pop, sort, etc.

- WHY SO MANY DATA STRUCTURES??

  - Different DATA STRUCTURES excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others
    (like arrays) are more generally used.

- WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT DATA STRUCTURES??

  - The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you will need to use one of these data structures.
  - You have already worked with many of data structures Unknowingly!
  - And of course... INTERVIEWS!

- There is NO ONE Best Data Structures
- They all excel in different situations

- SOME COMMON USE CASES:
  - Working with map/location data? ==> `GRAPH`
  - Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? ==> `LINKED LIST`
  - Web Scrapping nested HTML? ==> `TREE`
  - Need to write a Schedular? ==> `BINARY HEAP`

#### ES2015 Class Syntax

- OBJECTIVES

  - Explain what a class is
  - Understand how javascript implements the idea of classes
  - Define terms like `ABSTRACTION`, `ENCAPSULATION`, and `POLYMORPHISM`
  - Use ES2015 classes to implement data structures

- WHAT IS A CLASS??

  - A Blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods

- WHY DO WE NEED TO LEARN CLASSES??

  - We are going to implement `data structures` as `classes`

- Javascript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntatical sugar over Javascript's
  existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance
  model to javascript.
