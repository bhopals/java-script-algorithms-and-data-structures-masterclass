### Graph Traversal

- Searching or visiting Neighbors from a given node.

#### Intro to Graph Traversal

- Traversing Meaning - VISITING / UPDATING / CHECKING / PRINTING OUT / SEARCHING each Vertex in a GRAPH

- Problem Statements

  - Finding Nearest neighbours
  - Finding Most similar neighbours
  - Finding the shortest path from one Vertex to Another Vertex (GPS Directions)

- Every TREE is a GRAPH, but there are many many GRAPHS that are not TREES
- Any Node in a graph, there is no guarantee there is one unique path to get
- That means we may end up doing backtracking sometimes

- GRAPH TRAVERSAL USES

  - Peer to Peer Networking
  - Web Crawlers
    - The actual process of Traversing of Crawling is just a graph traversal
  - Finding `Closest`
  - Matches Recommendations
  - Shortest Path Problems
    - GPS Navigation
    - Solving Mazes
    - AI (Shortest Path to win the game)

- WAYS TO TRAVERSE IN GRAPHS
  - Depth First Search (DPS) Graph Traversal Iteratively
  - Depth First Search (DPS) Graph Traversal Recursively
  - Breadth First Search (DPS) Graph Traversal Iteratively
  - Breadth First Search (DPS) Graph Traversal Recursively
