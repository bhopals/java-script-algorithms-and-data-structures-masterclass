### Big O of Sorting Algorithms

- BUBBLE SORT

  - Time Complexity(Best)- `O(N)`
  - Time Complexity(Average) - `O(N^2)`
  - Time Complexity(Worst) - `O(N^2)`
  - Space Complexity - `O(1)`

- INSERTION SORT

  - Time Complexity(Best)- `O(N)`
  - Time Complexity(Average) - `O(N^2)`
  - Time Complexity(Worst) - `O(N^2)`
  - Space Complexity - `O(1)`

- SELECTION SORT

  - Time Complexity(Best)- `O(N^2)`
  - Time Complexity(Average) - `O(N^2)`
  - Time Complexity(Worst) - `O(N^2)`
  - Space Complexity - `O(1)`

#### Recap

- Sorting is fundamental
- BUBBLE SORT, SELECTION SORT, and INSERTION SORT are all roughly equivalent
- All have average time complexities that are QUADRATIC (`O(N^2)`)
- We can do better... but we need more complex algorithms
- All 3 Algorithms works better with smaller data set, so not very optimum for larger data set,
  and for that we have More sorting algorithms that we are going to discuss in next few chapters
